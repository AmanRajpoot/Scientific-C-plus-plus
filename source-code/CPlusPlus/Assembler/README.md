# Assembler

Some illustrations of assembly code, especially to write functions to call
from C/C++.

## What is it?

  1. `CalcSum`: assembly function that takes three integer arguments, and
    returns the sum.
  1. `HelloWorld`: standalone assembly program that prints a hello world
    message to standard output.
  1. `QuadCalc`: assembly function that takes a double precision floating
    point value and computes a quadratic expression.  Illustrates why it is
    hard to beat a good compiler.
